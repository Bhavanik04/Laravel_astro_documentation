## Blockquotes

> This is a blockquote, which is commonly used when quoting another person or document.
>
> Blockquotes are indicated by a `>` at the start of each line.


## Code blocks
A code block is indicated by a block with three backticks ``` at the start and end. You can indicate the programming language being used after the opening backticks.

```js
// Javascript code with syntax highlighting.
var fun = function lang(l) {
  dateformat.i18n = require('./lang/' + l);
  return true;
};
```
## Text markers

```js {2-3}
function demo() {
  // This line (#2) and the next one are highlighted
  return 'This is line #3 of this snippet';
}
```


```js "Individual terms" /Even.*supported/
// Individual terms can be highlighted, too
function demo() {
  return 'Even regular expressions are supported';
}
```

```js "return true;" ins="inserted" del="deleted"
function demo() {
  console.log('These are inserted and deleted marker types');
  // The return statement uses the default marker type
  return true;
}
```


```diff lang="js"
  function thisIsJavaScript() {
    // This entire block gets highlighted as JavaScript,
    // and we can still add diff markers to it!
-   console.log('Old code to be removed')
+   console.log('New and shiny code!')
  }
```

## Frames and titles

```js
// my-test-file.js
console.log('Hello World!');
```


```bash title="Installing dependencies…"
npm install
```

## Disable window frames with frame="none"

```bash frame="none"
echo "This is not rendered as a terminal despite using the bash language"
```
